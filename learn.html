      <article style="max-width:900px; margin-top:1rem;">
        <h2>What is an appraisal?</h2>
        <p>An appraisal is a professional, unbiased opinion of a property's market value prepared by a licensed appraiser. Appraisals are used by lenders, buyers, sellers, attorneys, and homeowners for financing, sale decisions, estate settlements, and tax matters.</p>

        <h2>Our four-step process</h2>
        <div class="learn-section">
          <details>
            <summary>Step 1 — Request & Intake</summary>
            <p>You submit property information and your goal (purchase, refinance, estate, etc.). We confirm scope, fees, and timeline.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Step 2 — Market Research</summary>
            <p>We analyze recent sales, active listings, and market trends in your area, and select comparable properties to analyze adjustments.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Step 3 — Report Preparation</summary>
            <p>We prepare a clear, defensible report with supporting data, photographs, maps, and reconciled value conclusions.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Step 4 — Delivery & Support</summary>
            <p>We deliver the report electronically and remain available to answer questions or provide additional explanation if needed.</p>
          </details>
        </div>

        <h2>Common appraisal types we provide</h2>
<div class="learn-section">

  <details>
    <summary>Full appraisal (URAR)</summary>
    <p>A full appraisal (often reported on the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report, or URAR) is the most detailed type of residential appraisal. It includes an interior and exterior inspection of the home, a full market analysis, photographs, maps, and adjustments for differences between the subject and comparable sales. These are most commonly used in mortgage lending, but they are also helpful for estates, divorce, tax appeal, or when a homeowner simply wants the most complete picture of their property’s value.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Exterior-only appraisal</summary>
    <p>An exterior-only appraisal (sometimes called a “drive-by” appraisal) involves inspecting and photographing the property from the outside only. The appraiser still analyzes recent market data and comparable sales but does not enter the home. This type of appraisal is faster and less intrusive, and is often used for lower-risk situations, portfolio updates, or when interior access isn’t possible. For personal use, it can provide a reliable opinion of value while keeping costs down.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Desk review / valuation opinion</summary>
    <p>A desk review or valuation opinion does not include a physical property visit. Instead, the appraiser reviews available sales data, listings, and other market information to form a professional opinion of value. This option works well when a client wants a quick estimate for planning purposes, such as considering a sale, checking equity, or evaluating options before listing a property. It is not suitable for lending but is useful for decision-making and market checks.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Rent schedule / 1007</summary>
    <p>A rent schedule (Fannie Mae form 1007) provides an appraiser’s opinion of the market rent for a single-family home or small multi-family property. The appraiser researches local rental data and compares it to the subject property to determine an appropriate rent level. Investors often order this to help with setting rent, evaluating a purchase, or reviewing a rental portfolio. Homeowners may also use it to understand rental potential before leasing out a property.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Small multifamily appraisal / Form 1025 (2–4 units)</summary>
    <p>Form 1025 is the small multifamily appraisal form used for 2–4 unit properties (duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes). Unlike a rent schedule, a Form 1025 provides a complete market value opinion and includes unit-level income and rent analysis when available. We use Form 1025 when lenders or investors require a full valuation for small multifamily income-producing properties.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Land appraisal</summary>
    <p>A land appraisal focuses on valuing vacant lots, acreage, or agricultural parcels. Since no home is present, the appraiser evaluates factors like location, size, zoning, topography, utility access, and comparable land sales. This type of appraisal is important for buyers and sellers of vacant lots, developers evaluating subdivision potential, and property owners dealing with estates or tax questions. It helps answer the key question: what is this land worth in today’s market?</p>

          <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Appraisals completed for private clients (such as homeowners, attorneys, or investors) are for informational and non-lending purposes only. For mortgage financing, the lender is the client and must order the appraisal directly through their required process. Reports provided by Elevate Appraisals to private parties cannot be substituted for a lender-ordered appraisal.
