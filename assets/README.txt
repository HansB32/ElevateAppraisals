Please add the logo files here to display on the site and as favicon.

Recommended filenames:
- summit-logo-full.png   -> the full logo (mark + text) used in the header
- summit-logo-mark.png   -> the mark only (triangle) used as favicon

If you only have a single combined image, you can use the same file for both names. Place the files in this folder: assets/

After adding, reload the pages in your browser. If you want, I can help resize or crop the mark if you upload the original image file.
